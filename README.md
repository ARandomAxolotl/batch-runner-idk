# **🎰 Command Runner: Nightmare Edition**
> *"Because if you really wanted to run that command, you'd be willing to suffer for it."*

Forget efficiency. This is a robust, multi-stage psychological gauntlet designed to prevent command execution through sheer exhaustion, randomized failure, and the constant threat of a system-killing fork bomb.

## **🚀 New "Features"**
* **The Absolute Luck Engine**: Unlike previous versions, confirmation is now 100% luck-based. The script rolls a random number (0-9); if your attempt count doesn't match the secret roll, you start the gauntlet over.
* **Artificial Latency Gauntlet**: Every "Y" confirmation triggers a mandatory series of fake processing stages:
    * **Pinging Servers**
    * **Verifying Computer**
    * **Authorizing User**
    * **Connecting to Remote Desktop**
    * **Installing Malware...** (Wait, what?)
* **Recursive Failure Logic**: At any moment, the script may claim "Connection Lost" or "Authorization Failed," sending you back to the start of the spinner loops.
* **The "Unexpected Error" Reset**: Even if you pass the gauntlet, the script may decide an "Unexpected error orcured," forcing you to re-accept the licenses and start the entire process from the very beginning.

## **🕹️ Usage**
1. **Enter Command**: Input the command you wish to run.  
2. **The Licenses**: Agree to the terms (if you dare).  
3. **The Grind**: Watch randomized spinners rotate for minutes at a time.
4. **The UAC Interruption**: Deal with Windows User Account Control prompts just for a "Hello World" window.
5. **Execution**: If the universe aligns and the `%RANDOM%` generator favors you, your command will finally execute.

## **🛠️ Debug Mode**
Trigger maximum screen-clutter by running:
`run.cmd -d` or `run.cmd --debug`

This will output:
* Every secret random number roll (so you can see exactly how unlucky you are).
* Internal logic fixes and stage transitions.

## **⚠️ Warning**
Do not use this script if you value your time, your sanity, or your computer's RAM.
